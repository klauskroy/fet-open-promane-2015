 Universität Leipzig was founded in 1409 and is the second oldest university in Germany where teaching has continued 
 without interruption. 
  Today it offers a wide spectrum of academic disciplines at 14 faculties with more than 150 institutes. 
  for close to 30 000 students taught by approximately 400 Professors, 
  resulting in more than 570 advanced degrees (PhD, etc.) annually.
  It is a member of the German U15, a strategic alliance of 15 major German research universities. 
  In the recently finished 7. Research Framework Programme of the EU the university participated 
  in 75 projects with an overall EC-contribution of some 25 million Euro. 
  Altogether, Universität Leipzig acquires more than 100 million Euro of third-party funds annually.

  The node participants are located at the Institute for Experimental Physics I and at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, 
  of the Faculty of Physics and Earth Sciences, which also comprises institutes for meteorology, geology, geophysics 
  and geography. 
  It counts among the leading faculties in terms of research output and external funding, within the university, 
  and hosts several ERC grantees. 
  It is the first faculty of the university that recently got its research activities evaluated by an external board of
  international experts. 
  The physics institutes make major contributions to several collaborative research centers (SFBs) funded by the 
  German Science Foundation (DFG) and to the interdisciplinary Graduate School ``Leipzig School of Natural Sciences -- 
  Building with Molecules and Nano-objects'' (www.buildmona.de), founded by a grant from the German Excellence Initiative,
  which has so far enrolled close to 200 PhD candidates. 
  They maintain collaborations and joint grants with a large number of independent international 
  and local research institutes for fundamental and applied science and industrial partners.

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

\begin{compactenum}
%
\item Joint organization of the Diffusion Fundamentals Conference V (2013). 
Joint Initiation of a workshop series "Hot Nanostructures"
(in 2011) continued every two years. It is focussed on non-equilibrium physics highlighting theory and experiments 
involving large temperature gradients and will return to Leipzig in 2017. 

\item Project lead (speaker) of the research unit 877 ``From Local Constraints to Macroscopic Transport'' of the German 
Science Foundation (DFG).

\item Partners in international collaborative projects (German Excellence Initiative, Agence National de la Recherche - 
German Science Foundation, DFG, German Israel Foundation, ESF)
\end{compactenum}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
The Institute of Theoretical Physics hosts its own water-cooled computer cluster, 
involving a subcluster of GPU servers reserved for the PI's massively parallel NEMD simulations, 
which provides sufficient resources for the project tasks.
